This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when traversing arrays.  The `Bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds.  The corrected version is provided in `BugSolution.java`.  This example highlights the importance of carefully checking array indices to prevent runtime exceptions.  Always ensure your loop conditions accurately reflect the array's valid index range.
